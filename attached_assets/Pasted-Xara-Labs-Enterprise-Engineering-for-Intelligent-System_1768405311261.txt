Xara Cortex™

AI Decision & Control Infrastructure

Xara Cortex is a standalone platform that sits between applications and AI execution, enforcing control before any AI action is allowed to run.

Cortex provides:

Model Control — which AI is allowed

Agent Control — what AI can do

Workflow Control — execution order

Policy Control — non-negotiable constraints

Full audit and observability

Cortex is optional and licensed separately.
